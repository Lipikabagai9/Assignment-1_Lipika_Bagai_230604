# SNAKE GAME

## Description
This is a classic snake game created in python using the pygame library.
The goal of the game is to help the snake eat food to grow longer while avoiding bumping into its own tail or the walls.

## How to Play
* Install python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).(In case you don't have it)
* Install Pygame by running `pip install pygame` in your command line or terminal.
* Download or clone the repository to your local machine. 
* Navigate to the directory containing the game files. Run the game by executing the `snake_game.py` file with Python.
* Now, for playing the game, use w (up), a (left), s (down), and d (right) keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.
Try to guide it to eat the red food pellets without running into the walls or its own tail.
* Every time the snake eats a food pellet, it gets longer and score is increased by 10 and the window size is reduced.
* If the snake runs into itself or the game boundaries, the game is over.
* Try to achieve the highest score possible by growing the snake as long as you can!
